## 📌 Overview
This repository showcases **cybersecurity audit and risk assessment reports** conducted using industry standard frameworks such as the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**. These assessments help identify risks, evaluate compliance with security best practices, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance security posture.

Each audit follows a structured approach:
1. **Scope Definition** – Identifying assets, systems, and processes covered in the audit.
2. **Risk Assessment** – Evaluating potential threats, vulnerabilities, and compliance gaps.
3. **Control Review** – Assessing security controls based on NIST CSF best practices.
4. **Recommendations** – Providing targeted security measures to mitigate risks and enhance compliance.
