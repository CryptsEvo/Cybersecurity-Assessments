This folder contains my completed threat modeling activity from the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**.

## üß† Scenario Overview

I took on the role of a security analyst for a growing company that sells and buys sneakers through a mobile app. My task was to use the **PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)** framework to identify:

- Business objectives
- Technical risks
- Threats and vulnerabilities
- Mitigation strategies

The app involves user authentication, product search, messaging, and payment processing, making it a prime candidate for early threat modeling.

## üîê Key Learnings

- APIs and SQL components must be hardened against injection and access abuse
- Threat modeling before launch reduces the risk of breaches
- Frameworks like PASTA help structure and prioritize security planning
