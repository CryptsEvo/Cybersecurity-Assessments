# Wireshark vs. tcpdump – Tool Comparison

This assignment is part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate** and focuses on comparing two widely used network traffic analysis tools: **Wireshark** and **tcpdump**.

---

## 📘 Assignment Overview

As a cybersecurity analyst, I was asked to research and compare **Wireshark** and **tcpdump** based on their functionality, usage scenarios, and technical capabilities. The goal was to clearly identify **at least two differences** and **three similarities** between the tools, then present them in a visual format.

## 📊 What's Inside

📄 **Wireshark-vs-tcpdump-Comparison.pdf**  
A Venn diagram style visual that highlights:

### 🟦 Wireshark (Left Circle)
1. Graphical user interface (GUI) with visual tools like color coding, flow graphs, and stream following.  
2. Ideal for deep packet inspection and analyzing multiple protocol layers.

### 🟥 tcpdump (Right Circle)
1. Command-line based analyzer; lightweight and efficient for quick traffic captures.  
2. Commonly used in headless or remote environments where GUIs are not available.

### 🟨 Similarities (Intersection)
1. Both are open-source and widely used for network traffic capture.  
2. Support saving traffic to PCAP files for later analysis.  
3. Both use **Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF)** syntax for packet filtering.

## 🔍 Key Takeaways

- **Wireshark** is better for visual and in-depth analysis.
- **tcpdump** excels in speed, simplicity, and remote usage.
- Both tools are essential in a security analyst’s toolkit for packet capture and filtering.
