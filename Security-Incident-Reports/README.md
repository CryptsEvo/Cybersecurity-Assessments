# Security Incident Reports

This folder contains real-world and simulated cybersecurity incident reports created as part of hands-on exercises in cybersecurity learning. Each report follows industry-standard frameworks such as NIST CSF or general best practices, focusing on detection, analysis, response, and mitigation.

## üìÅ Incident Reports Included

1. **DNS-ICMP-Traffic-Report**  
   - Focus: Malicious traffic detection  
   - Tools: Wireshark, Suricata

2. **Drive-By-Download & Brute Force Attack Report**  
   - Focus: Malware delivery + weak credential exploitation  
   - Framework: MITRE ATT&CK, Log Review

3. **Network Hardening Risk Assessment**  
   - Focus: Misconfiguration & security posture analysis  
   - Techniques: Baseline hardening, port review

4. **SYN Flood Attack Report**  
   - Focus: Denial-of-Service traffic behavior  
   - Tools: Packet analysis, Firewall log inspection

5. **DDoS Attack ‚Äì NIST CSF Report**  
   - Focus: Analyze DDoS using NIST Cybersecurity Framework  
   - Structure: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover
  
6. **USB Baiting Attack ‚Äì Rhetorical Hospital**

In this scenario-based assignment from the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, I played the role of a security team member at Rhetorical Hospital. A suspicious USB drive was found in the parking lot with HR-related files. The task was to:

- Review the contents of the USB
- Analyze how an attacker could use this data
- Propose mitigation strategies to reduce organizational risk
