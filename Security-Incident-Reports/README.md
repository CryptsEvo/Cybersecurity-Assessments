# Security Incident Reports

This folder contains cybersecurity incident reports written as part of practical learning and analysis activities in my cybersecurity journey. Each report investigates a specific type of network attack using real-world scenarios and packet capture analysis.

## üßæ Reports Included

### 1. **DNS and ICMP Traffic Log Incident Report**
- **Focus:** Investigates suspicious DNS and ICMP network traffic.
- **Tools Used:** Wireshark
- **Analysis:** Reviewed logs to detect possible unauthorized DNS tunneling or data exfiltration attempts.
